## Volunteer, teacher and cloud-developer

Always try to give my best and making this world a better place to be :). I was lucky enough to find [Migracode](https://migracode.openculturalcenter.org/) and being able to merge my programming passion and my will to help others. Most of my time I spend it learning new things. Currently, I'm working as a Cloud-engineer at [Ohpen](https://www.ohpen.com/) where I keep pushing my AWS+Serverless knowledge every day.

## People/Companies I worked with
- [Migracode](https://migracode.openculturalcenter.org/): Teaching refugees to become full-stack developers. Stack: Git, Javascript, Node.js and PostgreSQL. I also take care of a self-developed soft-skills curriculum about emotional intelligence, team-work and working under pressure.
- [Ohpen](https://www.ohpen.com/): Designing and implementing serverless systems for finance institutions in AWS. Owning the whole process. From CI/CD pipelines, deployments, monitoring and bug resolution. Mainly using AWS, Serverless, DynamoDB, RDS, Aurora, .Net, Node.js, Powershell and Python.
- [Woffu](https://www.woffu.com/en/): Designing and mantaining our web and mobile application as a backend developer. Mainly working with all the .Net stack (Azure, C\#, SQL and Table storage)
- [Fluendo](https://fluendo.com/es/): Designing desktop, mobile and web applications for the e-sports ecosystem. Mainly focused on Microsoft technologies such as C\# and  Azure with a back-end development role.
- [Aquiles Solutions](http://aquilessolutions.com/): Designing solutions for our clients. Main tasks: attending client meetings, implementing algorithms, designing applications and managing SQL databases.
- [Guillaume Verdier](http://www.guillaumeverdier.com/en/) and [Benjamin Muyl](https://www.bmuyl.com/): Developing a fluid-structure interaction program with Finite-Element method.
