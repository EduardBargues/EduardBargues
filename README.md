## Volunteer, teacher and cloud-developer

Always try to give my best and making this world a better place to be :). I was lucky enough to find [https://migracode.openculturalcenter.org/](Migracode) and being able to merge my programming passion and my will to help others. Most of my time I spend it learning new things. Currently, I'm working as a Cloud-engineer at [https://www.ohpen.com/](Ohpen) where I keep pushing my AWS+Serverless knowledge every day.
